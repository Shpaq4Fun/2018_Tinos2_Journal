% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
The problem of local damage detection in rotating machines is currently the highly important subject of interest. In the literature one can find many different strategies. One of the most common approaches is the vibration signal analysis aiming at informative frequency band selection. In case of simply structured signals classic methods (e.g. spectral kurtosis) are sufficient and return clear information about the damage. However, in real-world cases the signal is usually much more complicated. Indeed, such signals consist of many different components, for instance: damage-related cyclic impulses, high energy non-cyclic impulses not related to damage or heavy-tailed background noise etc. Hence, there is a growing need for robust damage detection methods. In this paper a novel method of informative frequency band selection is proposed. It utilizes the approach of Non-negative Matrix Factorization applied to time-frequency signal representation. The described algorithm is evaluated using simulated signal containing several different components, that resembles real-life vibration signal from copper ore crusher. Using the obtained structure of informative frequency band it is possible to filter particular components out of the original signal.

\section{Introduction}
Condition monitoring is highly important part of the maintenance of rotating machinery. One of the most common approaches is based on the analysis of the vibration signal. Recent methods for time-frequency analysis of rotating machinery is illustrated in \cite{feng2013recent,obuchowski2014recent}. Furthermore, the diagnostics of rolling elements bearing is described in details in \cite{randall2011rolling}. Interestingly, stochastic modelling methods are also powerful in case of condition monitoring. For instance, application of Schur filter \cite{Makowski2014130, lopatka2005effective} or autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions \cite{zak2014novel}.
The detection of damage can be also performed with selection of informative frequency band \cite{obuchowski2014selection}. The most classical approach is spectral kurtosis, which indicates the kurtosis for each frequency band in time-frequency representation of the signal \cite{antoni2006spectral, combet2009optimal}. In case of simple signal, which does not contain many different components spectral kurtosis is sufficient. On the other hand, in case of the machine working in harsh condition the condition monitoring is more complicated. Thus, the classical methods fail and the new approach should be proposed. One of the possible solution is an application of heavy tailed distribution, namely $\alpha$-stable distribution can be incorporated for informative band selection \cite{zak2016data}. Moreover, in case of the early stage of the damage another distribution can be applied. Indeed, the tempered stable distribution reveals an ability to detect smaller impulses \cite{wylomanska2016application}. In case of mining industry the working condition is harsh, there are many different sources of high energy noise. The contamination of vibration signal is high and cyclic impulses are hidden in the background noise. Therefore, the condition monitoring of the mining machinery is especially challenging \cite{bartelmus2014object}. The example of such machine is copper ore crusher. During the crushing process of big rocks high non-cyclic impulses are generated. The signal recorded on such machine was analysed in \cite{wylomanskaimpulsive}. The regime switching method for impulsive noise cancellation is used. As a result the signal component related to cyclic impulse is obtained. 

In this paper a different approach is proposed, that has been already studied in \cite{wodecki2017local}, namely the application of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to the time-frequency representation of the signal. It has been shown that NMF is a powerful tool in data analysis and clustering \cite{cichocki2009nonnegative, zdunek2008data, wang2013nonnegative,lee1999learning, he2011symmetric}. In proposed algorithm, authors factorize the spectrogram matrix, which is squared absolute value of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Furthermore, as the result the filter characteristic is designed. In this article the method is tested for the signal, which contain cyclic and high energy non-cyclic impulses. It is expected that each of this signal components can be extracted from original waveform.

The rest of the paper is structured as follow. In Section \ref{sec:methodology} the methodology is introduced, the theory of NMF is recalled and the flowchart of the algorithm is presented. The application of the algorithm for simulated data is contained in Section \ref{sec:sim data}. Finally, the conclusion is presented in the last Section.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
\subsection{Standard NMF with Euclidean objective}

Let $\bf{V}_{n\times m} $ denote an observed matrix {\bf  V} of
size $(n\times m)$ with non-negative elements. For such data matrix
${\bf V}$, Lee and Seung  proposed a factorization into two components \cite{lee2001algorithms}:
\beq\label{V1} {\bf V}_{n\times m}\simeq
      {\bf W}_{n\times r}*{\bf H}_{r\times m}. \eeq
      
     
All elements of the sought matrices ${\bf W}$ and ${\bf H}$ also have to be
non-negative, which is expressed by the constraints
\begin{align*}
    &v_{ij}\ge0,~~w_{ik}\ge 0,~~ h_{kj}\ge 0,\\
    &~~i=1, \dots, n; ~j=1,\dots, m;
                ~~k=1,\dots,r.
\end{align*}

The parameter $r$ is supposed to satisfy the in-equality: $r~<= min(n,m)$.
In the following, the parameter \emph{r} will represent the expected number of components in the signal.

The above formula says  that the original matrix \textbf{V} is
approximated by the product of two real-valued lower rank matrices: \emph{base matrix} ${\bf
W}_{n\times r}$ and \emph{encoding matrix} ${\bf H}_{r\times m}$  which have jointly less
elements than ${\bf V}$, i.e. the following inequality holds:
('$< <$' in (\ref{r1}) means: much smaller)

\begin{equation}\label{r1}
    (n+m)*r<\hspace{1pt}< n*m . 
\end{equation}

If truly formula (\ref{V1}) holds, which means, {\bf V} is well
approximated by the product {\bf W}*{\bf H}, then we may conclude that the
analyzed data matrix {\bf V} may be efficiently stored (and analyzed)
using only about (n+m)*r instead  of n*m data entries.

To approximately factorize $V\simeq{W*H}$, one should define cost function
that quantifies the approximation quality. It can be constructed
using distance measures between two matrices A and B. One of the most common and useful
measures is the square of the Euclidean distance:

\beq  
\norm{A-B}^2=\sum_{i,j}\left(A_{ij}-B_{ij} \right)
\eeq

Let us now consider an alternative formulation of such factorization as optimization problem: 
\newline
\begin{problem}
\label{prob:1}
Minimize $\norm{V-WH}^2$ with respect to $W$ and $H$, where $W,H \geq 0$
\end{problem}
~\\

The function $\norm{V-WH}^2$ is convex in terms of W or H exclusively, but not convex in both of them together. Hence, it is typically impossible to find global minima of the Problem 1. However, many optimization techniques can be applied to obtain them.
Perhaps the simplest one to implement is gradient descent, but its convergence is not very fast. Some other methods such as conjugate gradient converge quicker, at least in the neighbourhood of local minima, but are more complex to implement.

It has been determined by Lee and Seung that the following multiplicative update formulae are fast to compute and easy to implement for solving \ref{prob:1}:
\newline
\begin{theorem}
The Euclidean distance $\norm{V-WH}$ is non-increasing under the update rules 
\begin{equation}
    H_{\alpha\mu} \leftarrow H_{\alpha\mu}\frac{(W^TV)_{\alpha\mu}}{(W^TWH)_{\alpha\mu}} \quad
    W_{i\alpha} \leftarrow W_{i\alpha}\frac{(VH^T)_{i\alpha}}{(WHH^T)_{i\alpha}}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
~\\

In the practical implementation of the NMF algorithm matrix forms of presented equations have been used \cite{hoyer2004non}. Proof of convergence has been stated by Lee and Seung \cite{lee2001algorithms}. 

\subsection{Scope of the diagnostic algorithm}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.38\textwidth]{figs/block.png}
\caption{Flowchart of the diagnostic algorithm}
\label{fig: block}
\end{figure}

Functional flowchart of the proposed method is presented in Fig. \ref{fig: block}. Firstly, signal has to be transformed into a time-frequency domain. For such transformation spectrogram has been chosen, which is a square of absolute values of short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which for discrete data $x[0], x[1], ... , x[N-1]$ is defined as \cite{alan1989discrete}:

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{STFT}(n,k)=\sum_{m=0}^{L-1}x[n+m]w[m]e^{-j2\pi km/N},
\end{equation}
for $0\leq k \leq N-1$, and $w[.]$ is the window of length $L$. After that Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is applied to extract spectral information about different types of processes occurring in the signal. As a result, $r$ selectors are obtained as column vectors of base matrix {\bf W}, where $r$ is the predefined expected number of processes. Finally, input signal is filtered with FFT-based FIR filter using overlap-add method, where given selector is used as filter transfer function \cite{alan1989discrete}. At the end, envelope spectra of obtained signals are calculated to inspect fundamental and harmonic frequencies of the components.

\section{Simulated data analysis}
\label{sec:sim data}
\subsection{Description of simulated data}

Simulated signal is a composite of cyclic impulses with a cyclic frequency of
40 Hz and carrier frequency band of $2500-3500$ Hz, noncyclic
impulses with a center frequency 5000 Hz and varying
bandwidths. The cyclic impulse is simulated using MATLAB
function \emph{gauspuls} with a center frequency $F_c = 3000$ Hz
and uniformly distributed bandwidth on
[0.2, 0.3] interval. As a next step, a single impulse is repeated to obtain cyclic signal. Non-cyclic impulse is also simulated using \emph{gauspuls} function
but with a centre frequency $F_c = 5000$ Hz and uniformly distributed bandwidth on [0, 1] interval. Positions of the non-cyclic impulses are uniformly distributed
on the time axis. The model of the simulated signal is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:schemat sygnal}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/schemat.png}
    \caption{The schematic model of the signal}
    \label{fig:schemat sygnal}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}

Time series of simulated vibration data is presented in Fig. \ref{fig: input}. This data has been already addressed in \cite{wylomanskaimpulsive}, where other methods of IFB estimation have been described. Spectrogram is obtained for Hamming 256-sample length window with 220 samples overlapping and 512 FFT points. One can observe several strong, non-cyclic excitations emerging from the noise, but no cyclic impulses are visible. Even on spectrogram they are not very obviously noticeable (see Fig. \ref{fig: spectrogram}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/input_sig.eps}

\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/input_spec.eps}
\caption{Time-frequency representation of the input signal}
\label{fig: spectrogram}
\end{figure}

As a next step, NMF algorithm differentiates spectral profiles of previously described processes (see Fig. \ref{fig: selmat}). Based on the visual inspection of the spectrogram matrix, one can recognise that second cluster describes spectrum of cyclic impulsive component, and third component is responsible for the non-cyclic process.

\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/selector_matrix.png}
\caption{Matrix of IFB selectors obtained by NMF}

\end{figure}

Selectors used as transfer functions for the filtration step are presented in Fig. \ref{fig: selplots}.

\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/selector_plot.eps}
\caption{Plot of IFB selectors for three components}
\label{fig: selplots}
\end{figure}

Input signal (Fig. \ref{fig: outplots} a) has been filtered with two selectors extracting non-cyclic and cyclic components (Fig. \ref{fig: outplots} b and c respectively). Obtained signals carry information about random impacts being natural behavior of this type of machines, and cyclic impulsive process that denotes detected local damage.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/output_plots.png}
\caption{Results of filtration: a) original signal, b) non-cyclic impulses, c) cyclic impulses}
\label{fig: outplots}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{figs/output_specs2.png}
\caption{Envelope spectra of the results: a) original signal, b) non-cyclic impulses, c) cyclic impulses}
\label{fig: outspecs}
\end{figure}

In addition, quality and clarity of obtained components can be evaluated using envelope spectra (see Fig. \ref{fig: outspecs}). Spectrum of input signal (panel a) provides no conclusive information about the damage. Although there are several visible peaks in the spectrum, their presence and meaning is questionable. Envelope spectrum of non-cyclic component (panel b) looks random, which is expected effect because of randomness of impulses' bandwith and position in time domain. Finally, envelope spectrum of cyclic component (panel c) provides unquestionable series of peaks at fundamental and harmonic frequencies related to local damage (in this case 40 Hz and its multiples).

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper authors introduce new method of local damage detection in rotating machinery. Although the idea of selectors is widely known, it is proposed to perform Nonnegative Matrix Factorization of the spectrogram matrix and use base matrix as a selector bank. Analyzed data filtered with obtained selectors reveal the underlying component processes occurring in the signal, most important being the cyclic impulsive component related to local damage. Differentiation of spectral structure allows to properly distinguish particular classes of existing processes.
